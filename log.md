# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<hr>

### Day 1: July 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Tried working on a solution for reversing a string with a while loop. 

**Thoughts**   
I have seen numerous examples of solving this with a for loop, recursion and built-in methods. A while loop may not be the optimal, but I wanted to mix things up to see if it was possible to solve.

### Day 2: July 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Was able to reverse a string with a for loop. Unable to solve recursively(need to get a better
understanding of syntax).

**Thoughts**   
Today I've learned:
* `length` method can be applied to arrays and string
* Javascript follows the _lexical scope_ principle 
  * i.e. in nested functions, the inner function has access to both inner and outer variables. Whereas the outer function only has access to outer variables.

### Day 3: July 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Skipped a day because I fell asleep last nightðŸ˜“. Was unable to reverse a string recursively.   

**Thoughts**     
Kept trying to make my solution similar to a for loop by declaring variables.  
Recursion is sometimes not the most optimal solution, which is true in this case.  

Today I've learned:
* build-in methods `substr()` and `charAt()` are required to solve problem

### Day 4: July 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted _Sock Merchant_ problem from Hacker Rank on *Repl.it* website. Was able to solve for key-paired values sock object.  

**Thoughts**     
Hacker Rank considered this a warmup problem, but it is definitely not for beginners.  

Today I've learned:
* how to create/add key-paired values to an empty object with conditional statement

### Day 5: July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to _Sock Merchant_ problem on *Repl.it* again. Was able to target all property values. Was unable to get tally of even pairs of socks to solve problem.

**Thoughts**     
Once I am able to get tally of even pairs, this solution will need to be combined with first solution(key-paired values sock object).

Today I've learned:
* `Object.values` method can be used to return property values within an object

### Day 6: July 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to solve _Sock Merchant_ problem on *Repl.it* again. Was able to get tally of all even pairs with reduce method.

**Thoughts**     
The `reduce` method is a powerful one and can be used to perform tally-up an object for number of occurrence and getting total count of an array. Will attempt to use only `reduce` to arrive at solution.

### Day 7: July 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to solve _Sock Merchant_ problem on *Repl.it* on final time. Was unable to combine *for loop* with *reduce* method successfully. This was probably due to scoping issues from the *reduce* function. 

**Thoughts**     
After looking at HackerRank solutions, I had the correct idea with solving for object then solving for even pairs. This does give me some assurance.

### Day 8: July 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to review other users solutions from HackerRank. Was unable to understand solutions and get them to work in text editor.

**Thoughts**     
Instead of copying/pasting  solutions in text editor try to recreate the problem and apply solution in a different text editor.

### Day 9: July 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Took an assessment(expired) for a job I previously applied for. Format of the test was as follow:  
* 5 multiple choice problems
* 1 Array sort problem
* 2 React project problems 

**Thoughts**     
Will look for similar problems to practice with. Unfortunately I was unable to start server after cloning project.

<hr>

### Day 10: July 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to sort an array in meandering order. Was able to sort array in descending order but not in meandering order. 

**Thoughts**     
Today I've learned:  
* methods such as `push`, `unshift` cannot be applied to an empty variable

### Day 11: July 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to sort an array in meandering order. Was unable to solve even after looking at a solution for a similar problem. 

**Thoughts**     
Will have to take things down a notch working then work my way up toward interview type questions.

### Day 12: July 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Started the **10 Days of JavaScript** challenge on HackerRank. Was able to solve *Day 2: Conditional Statement: Switch*.

**Thoughts**     
Taking it back to the basic to build momentum   
Today I've Learned:  
* fall-though technique can be used for multiple cases that will execute the same statement
* return statement cannot be used inside switch statement

### Day 13: July 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted to solve a loop and *Regex* problem. Was unsuccessful and may be over complicating problem with a *for* or *while* loop. 


**Thoughts**     
Try to solve problem without using a *for* or *while* loop and only `match()` with *Regex*

### Day 14: July 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted to solve Loop problem with Regex again. Was unsuccessful when trying to use both `exec` and `match` method in a function.

**Thoughts**     
After looking at solution, Regex was not required as it was not part of the lesson. That said, I was over complicating the problem with trying to use Regex. The problem could have been solved using two for loop.

### Day 15: July 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Reviewed and broke down submitted solutions to the *Loop* problem for understanding. 

**Thoughts**   
Today I've Learned:    
* *for...of* statement is a shorthand way of iterating over an object that is iterable. 

<hr>

### Day 16: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted to solve *Array* problem on HackerRank. Was unable to target last element of array for a conditional statement to arrive at solution. 

**Thoughts**   
After looking at multiple solutions I came pretty close to solving this problem. My strategy was the following:  
* 1. sort through the array(ascending order)
* 2. remove duplicates
* 3. target second to last element and return value

### Day 17: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted the *Try, Catch, and Finally* problem on HackerRank. Was unsuccessful, however my attempt in repl.it did return the correct results.

**Thoughts**   
More than likely will have to try and use *conditional catch-blocks* to arrive at correct solution.

### Day 18: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted the *Try, Catch, and Finally* problem again. After looking at the solution it appears we need to chain all methods(*Try, Catch, Finally*)inside the global function. 

**Thoughts**   
In practice, control flow will satisfy most error handling scenario unless an *exception* is required be called.

### Day 19: July 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted *Throw* problem on HackerRank and was able to solve. The purpose of this exercise was to learn how to throw different exceptions for custom error messages.

**Thoughts**   
Today I've learned: 
* There are 3 types of errors in programming  
  * Syntax Error(Parsing Error)
  * Runtime Error(Exception)
  * Logical Error
* Resource: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-throw/topics/javascript-errors

### Day 20: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Checked out https://binarysearch.io/ for the first time. Created a chat room for a problem I wanted to solve. It is probably suggested to plan chat room ahead of time due to lack of active users. 

Problem attempted was *Sum of Two Numbers* which was listed as an easy problem. 

**Thoughts**   
Based on the provided hint, I will need to learn how to use a *hash table* to solve.

### Day 21: July 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Reviewed *Hash Table* on Colt's Steele Algorithm and Data Structure course: https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/

Topics covered today includes:  
 * What is a Hash Table
 * Example of Hash Tables in *Objects* and *Map* 
 * Writing a Hash Table for string input

**Thoughts**   
I am still not too sure how this will help solve the *Sum of Two Numbers* problem.

### Day 22: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Continued reviewing *Hash Table* and learned how to handle collision with *Separate Chaining* and *Linear Probing*. 

Topics covered today includes:  
 * Handling collision
 * *Separate Chaining* and *Linear Probing* 
 * Using *set* and *get* method with *Separate Chaining* 

**Thoughts**   
Need to understand this data structure thoroughly as it is one of the most common one.

### Day 23: August 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Continued reviewing *Hash Table* and learned how to retrieve a *keys* and *values* array.

**Thoughts**   
The working example does not account for duplicates and is only intended to detail what happens under the hood.

### Day 24: August 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Finished course on *Hash Table* and learned that all Hash functions has Big O Notation, O(1) or constant time. As the number of input grows only one operation will be required to execute function. 

**Thoughts**
The best and worst Hash functions will always be O(1), this includes operations such as *Insertion*, *Deletion* and *Access*.  

<hr>

### Day 25: August 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Took a React assessment from a recruiter. Test format was multiple choice, allowing multiple answers, with each correct/wrong answers holding a different value.  

**Thoughts**  

<hr>

### Day 26: August 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Applied for a remote UI Engineer role and looked into how to add numbers to a Hash Table. The exampled covered from previous day only work on strings. 

**Thoughts**  
Need to find a working example for adding numbers to a Hash Table. 

<hr>

### Day 27: August 6, 2020
Attempted *Sum of Two Numbers* problem again and did not solve. After peaking at solution to a similar problem, a brute force nested loops or one pass hash table will solve the problem.

**Today's Progress**  
No progress made, but I've decided to look at solution because I had a feeling writing out a Hash Table function from scratch was not practical(since this was an "easy" problem).

**Thoughts**  
Created an Object to iterate over was part of solution. Will need to break down the solution line by line for understanding.

<hr>

### Day 28: August 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Went over the *Two Sum* solution to get a better understanding of *Map* object. 
*Mozilla* definition of a *Map* object is:  
 * it holds key-value pairs and remember the original insertion order of the keys
 * any value(both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or value

 In attempt to solve another problem, I mixed up these two methods *for...in* and *for...of*.
 *Mozilla* definition for both are the following:  
  * *for of*:  
    * is use to iterate over the values in an iterable, like an array
  * for in*:  
    * is use to iterate over the property of an object or used to iterate over the index value of an array  

**Thoughts**  
Practice more problems and try not to get too obsessed with remembering definitions. 

<hr>

### Day 29: August 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Read material about Map object and went over examples for creating, setting and getting key-pair values.

### Day 30: August 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Took a HTML/CSS/JavaScript assessment from the same source as React assessment. Results 56 out of 100: Weak. 

**Thoughts**  
There were 30 questions total. I am not too worried with my results as I do not think it is a complete assessment of my overall knowledge on topic. 

Top 3 areas in needs of improvements:  
  1. CSS Attributes and Properties
  2. HTML Images and External Documents
  3. Using JavaScript 

<hr>

### Day 31: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Started prepping for Hacker Rank JavaScript Skills Certificate Test. This time will prep for 7 days and take exam next Monday(Day 38). Topics to study for assessment includes:  

* Functions, Events and Error Handling(2 days)
* Currying(2 days)
* Hoisting, Scope, Inheritance(3 days)

**Thoughts**  
Need to find out how many questions and what type of challenges will be on exam.

### Day 32: August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Reviewed materials on *Arrow Functions*, *map()* and *ternary operator* and went over examples of each. Attempted *Arrow Functions* on Hacker Rank and was able to solve! :D 

**Thoughts**  
 My long extended approach to solving problem was:  
 * 1. Read documentation on primary concept and work on examples
 * 2. Read documentation on secondary concepts and work on examples
 * 3. Combine all concepts toward solving given problem 

Once I get a better understanding and retention of these concepts my process can be trimmed.

### Day 33: August 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Read articles on the purpose of *Currying* and how it works. By definition Currying is when a function which takes multiple argument is broken down to a series of functions each with one parameter. Benefits are simplify code and caching expensive operation.  

**Thoughts**  
Currying is a tricky one and I will need to revisit for retention and understanding.

### Day 34: August 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted to review *Hoisting, Scope and Inheritance* only to realize this was too much to take within one study session. Ended up focusing on *Classes* because *inheritance* is a functionality of *Classes* 

**Thoughts**  
These are pretty advance topic so I will probably need to cover prerequisites concepts first.  

<hr>

### Day 35: August 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted to solve *Classes* problem on HackerRank but was unsuccessful. After looking at solution I had the correct idea.

**Thoughts**  
Over complicating the solution either means that you do not understand the problem and/or do not have a strategy for solving the problem. If your strategy does not work, then you need to test your assumption and make sure there are no syntax errors. 

Today I've learned:  
* input argument does not have to be represented explicitly in *constructor* method  
 * for example the array for rectangle([10,20,10,20]) was represented with object *sides* property
 * *sides* property was initialize in the `Polygon`  
* syntax for *constructor* method is always the same: 
* `constructor ([argument]){ ... }`

### Day 36: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted *Rectangle Object* and *Count Object* problem on HackerRank. Was able to solve only *Rectangle Object* problem.

**Thoughts**  
For the first problem reading resource materials and going over examples did help. The second problem was more complicated and will require another attempt. Looking at the hidden code in text editor on Hacker Rank provides a lot of hints. 

Today I've Learned:  
* Accessing object property with bracket notation should be used when property names are dynamically determined(not known until run time).

### Day 37: August 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted *Count Object* problem on HackerRank and was able to solve. 

**Thoughts**  
After attempting problem with *for loop* strategy for 3hrs, I realized that it was not going to work. 
However, I did do a good job on working over small examples with this attempt. Eventually I switched to a `filter` strategy and was able to solve in 15 minutes. 

Today I've Learned:  
* When a strategy is not working don't get obsessed over it and move on to another strategy

### Day 38: August 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Took the HackerRank Javascript "basic" assessment and do not attempt. 

**Thoughts**  
There was nothing "basic" about it, as I had a hard time understanding the problems itself. This was probably the most difficult assessment I ever attempted, even more difficult then the one I received from actual companies. 

<hr>

### Day 39: August 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Applied for a Dev job on LinkedIn. Messaged and followed up with a recruiters. 

**Thoughts**  
Something I get writer's block when writing a cover letter. Some companies are less appealing than others. 

<hr>

### Day 40: August 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted *Array* problem(again) on Hacker Rank and was able to solve. My strategy for solving problem was the following:  
  1. Sort array from lowest to highest
  2. Remove duplicates 
  3. Return second highest integer 

**Thoughts**  
Although my solution was not the most succinct or optimal, I was able to solve the problem with a pragmatic approach. 

Today I've Learned:  
* `sort()` can be used to sort an array in ascending or descending order
* `indexOf` can be used with *index* keyword within `filter()` callback to determine unique values
* `Set`object is used to store unique values of any types

 ### Day 41: August 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Applied for a UI Software Developer job on LinkedIn. A recruiter for a job I applied to recently messaged me and I messaged back.

**Thoughts**  
Will attempt a Hacker Rank problem before midnight and kick it into overdrive. 

<hr>

 ### Day 42: August 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted *Inheritance* problem on Hacker Rank. Was about to solve only 1 out of 2 test cases. The test case for *Square* class was tricky because it only contained 1 property, whereas the *Rectangle* class contained 2 properties. 

**Thoughts**  
For the second test case the *constructor* method will convert `this.w` and `this.h` to the value of *s*

```class Square extends Rectangle {
  constructor(s){
    super(s,s)
  }
}
```

Today I've Learned: 
* *extends* is used to create a inheritance  
 * classes that uses *extends* are called child classes or subclasses
* a subclass inherit the superclass method and behaviors but can also declare new ones and override existing ones 
* Inheritance is useful for code reusability

 ### Day 43: August 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Applied for a dev role at a Healthcare software company. Application did require writing a cover letter and answering a question about self. Attempted the *Template Literals* problem on Hacker Rank which was NOT good question as it required more than just applying the *Template Literals* concept. 

**Thoughts**  
The challenges in *10 Days of JavaScript* are meant to reinforce concepts and are not typical of what will be seen during assessment for technical interviews.  

Today I've Learned:  
* Template Literals can be used for spanning strings across multiple lines
* can contain place holder: `${expression}` which can be passed into a function

 ### Day 44: August 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Started *Binary Tree* card on LeetCode and reviewed concepts on what is a tree, Binary Tree and how to traverse a tree.

**Thoughts**  
 The overall design of the LeetCode website is appealing. I also like the visual animation for the Traverse examples. 

Today I've Learned:  
* Pre-order Traversal(RT-L-R):  
 1. visit the root first
 2. then traverse the left subtree
 3. finally, traverse the right subtree

* In-order Traversal(L-RT-R):
 1. traverse the left subtree first
 2. then visit the root
 3. finally, traverse right subtree

 * Post-order Traversal(L-R-RT):
  1. traverse the left subtree first
  2. then traverse the right subtree
  3. finally, visit the root

 ### Day 45: August 24, 2020

 **Today's Progress**  
 Did not code today. Had to reformat my resume at the request of a recruiter. Hopefully they can understand why I chose a functional format resume over chronological format. 

 <hr>

## Day 46: August 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Decided to learn take a few steps back and learn recursion before Traversal methods. Review materials on Recursion on Colt's Steel course on Udemy.

Recursion is a function that call itself until a condition is met. Understanding the *Call Stack* is important to see how Recursion works under the hood.
 
<hr>

## Day 47: August 26, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Review 2 recursion examples. Review the requirements for structuring a recursive function. 

**Thoughts**  
Requirements for a recursive function are:  
 * 1. Base case
 * 2. Recursive case  
   * with a different parameter for each case

## Day 48: August 27, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Reviewed call stack in dev tools to get better understanding of recursion. Wrote a description of walk through for a recursive function. Learned about common pit falls of recursive functions, which includes:  
 * no base case(or wrong base case)
 * forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing

## Day 49: August 28, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Reviewed final section on Recursion for Udemy course. Topics included *helper function* and *pure recursive* function. A *helper function* design pattern is helpful when we need to return a new array. It requires a few more lines of code but is more understandable and has completeness. 

**Thoughts**  
Corrected an assumption I made from *Day 10*  
* Assumption: methods such as `push`, `unshift` cannot be applied to an empty variable
* Correction: `push` and `unshift` **can** be applied to an empty variable when it is outside of the function scope

## Day 50: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Attempted *reverse* exercise from Udemy course. Objective is to write a recursive function that will return a string in reverse. Did not solve yet...will attempt again tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**  
Need to work on recursive case. Things to remember:  
 * recursive case must take a new parameter for each call
 * recursive case must be returned 
 * use a *helper function* for completeness(optional)

 Possibly helper methods:  
  * *substr*, *substring*, *slice*

**Today's Progress** 
Attempted *reverse* again and was unsuccessful. Just to redeem some confidence attempted *power* exercise and was able to solve.

**Today's Progress** 
Prep for interview with Recruiter from *Reibus*. Unfortunately did not review the notes prior to interview. Attempted *factorial* problem and was able to solve with comments detailing call stack. The solution may have been based on memory.   

**Thoughts**  
 After researching and taking notes on a company, make sure to review it right before interview. 
 Did not do too well on interview as I stumbled a lot and was not speaking clearly and concisely when answering questions.

## Day 53: September 1, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Attempt *productOfArray* problem on Udemy and was able to solve. 

Approach was the following:  
 * use the zero index of *arr* to hold value we want to return: `arr[0]`
 * for each recursive case *pop* the last element from the initial array and multiply it against `arr[0`]`
 * when we are left with one element, it will be the cumulative product of the array 
 * we finally return the value of that array

**Thoughts**  
This one was a bit tricky because we needed to iterate through the array without creating a new variable into memory. We also needed to determine how to multiply the last element against the first element.

## Day 54: September 2, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Dusted off my portfolio project and started working on it again. Merged a few pull requests to fixed vulnerability issues. Need to fixed issue with pushing working branch to `origin dev`.  

Issue: *tip of current branch is behind its remote counterpart*  
Solution: merge *remote* dev branch to *working* dev branch with a `git pull`. If local branch is up-to-date then do a `git pull --rebase`.

**Thoughts**  
Felt lost and confused working on portfolio. Its been over 2 months.

## Day 55: September 3, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Attempted another recursive problem and was able to solve. Attempted to fix issue with portfolio repo but was unsuccessful. No sure why but `Feature/blog-page` branch does not seem to be tracking remote repo. I am unable to `push origin dev` when making changes. 

**Thoughts**  
Might have to delete `Feature/blog-page` entirely. Will test other branches and see if they are experience the same issues. Might have to delete `Feature/blog-page` entirely. Felt like a complete newb on the command-line today.

Attempted to fix issue with `Feature/blog-page` again and was unsuccessful. Did test `Feature/GraphQL` and it had the same issue, but I was able to fix issue(pushing changes to `origin dev`). Solution was doing a `git pull rebase origin dev`. Unfortunately this did not work for `Feature/blog-page`.

**Thoughts**

## Day 58: September 6, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Was able to fix problem with *detached head* on branch for my portfolio site repo. It turns out I kept on making a command line error without even realizing it. Such a total newbie mistake! 

While on working branch `Feature/blog-page`  
 * I kept on pushing to origin with `git push origin dev`
 * When I should have pushed to origin with `git push origin Feature/blog-site` 

Also attempt *Fibonacci* problem on Udemy and was able to solve. Was able to determine solution by looking at how *Fibonacci* are calculated in sequence. 

**Thoughts**  
When you cannot find the solution to a *Git* repo or command line issue, chances are you made a typo or inputted the wrong command without even realizing it.

## Day 60: September 8, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Attended first Zoom Meetup for a React group in Atlanta. Everyone seem pretty friendly and the guest speaker was really knowledgeable. 

**Thoughts**  
Todays presentation was about *Progressive Imaging and Handling in Webpack*. Techniques for improving loading of images includes:  
 * Lazy Loading
 * Eager Loading

## Day 72: September 21, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Wrote a step-by-step summary for how one of the component in the *clutch-weather-app* was set up with Redux. The summary was split into 2 sections:     
 * how the component is set up 
 * how the component state is updated  

**Thoughts**  
The purpose of the summary was to get a better understanding of Redux state management. I am not too sure how useful this summary will be...hopefully it can be serve as a reference. Lastly, from a quick Google I stumbled upon this article. [explain Redux like I'm five | Redux Cheatsheet](https://dev.to/rahuldkjain/redux-cheatsheet-23g2). Seem like an interesting and insightful read.

## Day 73: September 22, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
May have spread myself thin today. Completed and attempted a few things:   
* organized take-away summary from last week's interview for future reference  
* finished summary of yesterday component story for *clutch-weather-app*
* finished reading [this](https://dev.to/rahuldkjain/redux-cheatsheet-23g2) Redux article and made some notes.  
  * also created my own summary to get a better understanding 
* attempted to work on creating an event handler for *form-unit-test* project in order to write a unit test  
  * at this stage of the day I was burnt out and not really focused. 

**Thoughts**  
Expanding on the Redux article and wrote out a simple way to better understand Redux by comparing it to a Bank. Redux manages state like how a bank manages money. Key concepts of a bank and Redux are the following:  


## Redux Bank :bank: ##
Purpose: understand Redux better with a real world analogy. Redux manages state like how a bank manages money. 

**Store:** responsible for holding the *state*  
**Bank Vault:** responsible for hold all the *cash* 

**State:** the data that is placed in the *store*  
**Cash:** the money that is placed in the *bank vault*

**Reducer:** the function that updates the *state*, only they have access to the *store*  
**Teller:** the person handling the *transaction*, only they have access to the *bank vault*  

**Action:** objects that defines how to update the *state*   
**Transaction:** the task required to process the *cash*

## Day 74: September 23, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Messaged recruiter back on LinkedIn and scheduled a call with another for tomorrow. Applied for a junior role at a local startup but application was buggy. Luckily I was able to apply directly on company site. Had a hard time writing a unit test and event handler to simulate a button click in **form-unit-test**. This was due to me not realizing that `App.js` is a stateless function component. Although it is possible to write handlers for function component, it is not best practice. 

**Thoughts**  
Will have to create a component class event handler  
Will experiment with handlers for function component   
This could be a good opportunity to learn *Hooks* also

## Day 75: September 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Worked on *form-unit-test* and wrote out a functional component with event handler. Was able to get event handler to work. Was unable to get unit testing for even handler to work. 

**Thoughts**  
 * Will have to determine if unit test is not working because component is  a class
 * May have to learn *Context API* if I decide to work with a stateful component

## Day 76: September 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**
RSVP a few online meetups for October. Was able to submit a job application I started the other day due to a bug. Was able to successfully write a unit test for a function component. Solution was to change `onClick` method to `onSubmit` within `<form>`. See link below for working example. 

**Thoughts**  
Still not sure if this test would be best practice due to the component structure. Need to research how an actual login form is constructed. From there replicate the structure without actual having it routed. Must try to keep it as simple but realistic as possible.

While looking at how to write a form in React with Hooks, got caught up with relearning object destructuring. Destructuring *objects* and *array* is essential for writing clean and succinct code. It is also an effective for creating *ad hoc* data when needed. 

**Thoughts**  
Went down the learning rabbit hole with this one. Not a waste of time because *destructuring* should be used as often as possible.

Applied for a Full Stack role at a consulting company. Started working on Portfolio again. Completed the following:  
* modify and shorten `.env` file
* remove `target=_blank` to prevent vulnerability and for UX best practice
* add Contentful credential to Netlify environment build 

**Thoughts**  
It's been over 2 week since I worked on portfolio. There is no need to write a blog before deployment. Need to stop finding excuses to further delay site launch. 

<hr>

## Day 79: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Searched for jobs on several websites. Why are there some many expired jobs on LinkedIn? Applied for a role at a media company. Looked into different frameworks for developing image editing software, notable frameworks includes:  
* GIMP(GNU Image Manipulation Program)  
* GTK(GNOME Toolkit)
* GEGL(Generic Graphic Library)
* ImageMagicK
* OpenCV(Computer Vision) 

**Thoughts**  
The research on image editing tools stems from my photography hobby. I am probably better off being a user of these tools instead of a builder.

## Day 80: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Worked on the portfolio and did removed a few unnecessary files. Also attempted to remove Gatsby favicon but was unable to.

**Thoughts**  
Similar to coding challenges after a few attempts on a certain task, don't get fixated on it. Move on and get back to it later, especially if it is a minor task.   

<hr>

## Day 81: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Attempted to use `gatsby-image` component to render thumbnail images on portfolio page. Was unsuccessful due to an error with structuring query in `image.js` file: `The fragment "GatsbyImageSharpFixed" does not exist.`

**Thoughts** 
Was unaware that referencing `jpeg` from source file into a `<img>` was not possible with Gatsby. Need to read this article to get a better understanding for using `gastby-image`.  

[gatsby-image README.md](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-image)

## Day 82: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Attempted to work with `gatsby-images` again by downloading and reviewing `gastby-starter-kit`. Everything looked good when comparing my code base to the starter kit. Eventually ran into the same `fragment` issues again. 

**Thoughts** 
Need to get a better understanding of how GraphQL query are structure with `GraphiQL` and `graphql-playground` to determine why there is a issue with fragment.

## Day 83: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Was able to get conditional statement *Picture not found* in `images.js` to return on DOM. Possible causes `scoreKeeper.jpeg` not rendering onto page are:  
* not properly distinguishing `image` file in **gatsby-config.js**
* not properly setting fixed width/height for `<Image />` in **portfolio.js**

Search, found, modify resume and applied for a Front End role at a consulting company. Attempted to pull assets from Contentful to Gatsby but did not get too far. Will do a deep dive tomorrow and take a look at tutorial for reference. 

<hr>

## Day 85: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Was able to get `gatsby-image` to work on portfolio site. Root cause of issue not working was due to typo in mixing up `GatsbyImageSharpFixed` and `GatsbyImageSharpFluid` in GraphQL query.

**Thoughts** 
It is common that a bug lies in an obvious typo when copying code without understanding how it works.  

<hr>

## Day 86: October 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Was able to get multiple images to render on portfolio page. This was achieved by doing the following:  
* create a component for each project thumbnail
* write query for each component using `gatsby-image` design pattern
* import all components and render on portfolio page 

**Thoughts** 
The above approach required more files to be created to render thumbnail for each project. A possibility for rendering multiple images in one component is provided in the following links:  
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63912871/how-can-i-dynamically-add-images-to-my-pages-in-gatsby-using-the-image-component

*Note: This approach may be expensive and cause a lot of bloating if there are many images stored locally.*

## Day 87: October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Attempted to use Sass preprocessor to style components and make page responsive but was unsuccessful. Some of the concepts attempted were *variables*, *nesting* and *partials* similar to previous project.

**Thoughts** 
File `index.scss` contains a lot of selectors and declarations that was downloaded, therefore I do not know what many of them are doing. It also appears that this file has specificity priority. Will plan to start Sass preprocessor from scratch to get a better understand and better manage styling.

## Day 88: October 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Was able to make portfolio page responsive. Created a `max-width` breakpoint for smaller size screen with `flex-direction: column`. Resources to get this completed was from [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_flexbox_responsive).

**Thoughts** 
Took a long time looking at collapsible nav menus examples to integrate for project. Was able to find a few good ones [Free Frontend](https://freefrontend.com/css-menu/).
